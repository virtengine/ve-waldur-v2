Web hook installation
---------------------

It's possible to track updates of JIRA issues and apply them to Waldur immediately.

An instruction of JIRA configuration can be found at
https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis/webhooks

Step by step guide:

1. Log in to JIRA as administrator

2. Click on a cogwheel in the upper right corner and pick 'System'.

3. Scroll down to the lower left corner and find a "WebHook" option under the Advanced tab.

4. Now click on "Create a Web Hook"
You will be presented with a web hook creation view. There are only 3 mandatory fields - Name, Status and Url.

4.1 Name your hook

4.2 Select whether you want to enable it. It can be disabled at any moment from to the same menu.

4.3 Configure a url to send a "POST" request to. For instance: http://waldur.example.com/api/support-jira-webhook/
It is not needed to add any additional fields to request.

*Note: In case of VirtualBox localhost usually is 10.0.2.2. So the complete url will be next:
