Valimo authentication plugin
----------------------------

Valimo endpoint allows to get Waldur authentication token using mobile PKI from Valimo.
Please note, that only authentication is supported - no auto-registration is currently available.

* To initiate a login process, please issue POST request against **/api/auth-valimo/** endpoint
  providing phone number as an input.

* On that request Waldur will create a result object (**AuthResult**) and request authentication
  from the Valimo PKI service. The result object contains all the metadata about the request, including
  field "message" - text that is sent to the user via SMS. This text is typically shown to the user
  for validation purposes.

* The client is expected to poll for the authentication process by issuing POST requests
  against **/api/auth-valimo/result/** with UUID in the payload of a request. Please see details in the API
  documentation.

* After a successful login, endpoint **/api/auth-valimo/result/** will contain authentication token.
